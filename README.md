Introduction
This is a fully-featured real-time chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) along with additional powerful technologies like Socket.io for real-time communication and TailwindCSS for styling. Users can create accounts, log in, and chat with their friends seamlessly. This project showcases my ability to build and deploy a complex web application from scratch, making it a perfect demonstration of my skills for internship opportunities.
